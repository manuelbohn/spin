## Structure

-   Experiments can be found in `experiments/`.

    -   To run the experiments, download the repository and open the respective `.html` file.

-   The main manuscript and the supplementary material can be found in `paper/`.

    -   For an easy to read version, open the respective `.pdf` file

    -   For a nicely rendered version of the supplementary material open `supplementary_material.html`

    -   To access the code for the analyses reported in the paper or the supplementary material, open the respective `.Rmd` files.

-   All data sets can be found in `data/`.

-   Code for cognitive models and Bayesian parameter estimation can be found in `webppl/`.

    -   `llh_model.wppl` contains the code for the model comparison

    -   `prediction_all_models.wppl` generates model predictions for all models of the prediction section

    -   `.wppl` files starting with `explanation_` generate model predictions for the respective model of the explanation section

-   Processed model predictions for probabilistic models and some summary statistics are saved as `.rds` files in `saves/`.

-   Raw samples for the model comparison and model predictions can be downloaded [here](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/d/7ae3805dba064bada8e5/)
